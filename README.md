# Weather-Forecast

## Description

This project was made to be able to provide a weather forecast upon searching for a city that would display current and future wind, humidity and temperature conditions. In the process I learned a lot about utilizing ways to create elements through javascript as well as being able to fully utilize API's.

## Usage

At the moment, the search bar is not yet functional. In the process of working on this assignment, the 5-day weather forecast API updated to where it gives you weather for the next 5 days and every 3 hours in the five days resulting in massive arrays being created and requiring additional code to update the results to be a 5 day forecast. Thus, the results will show as 3 hour forecasts for now. This application is made soley to demonstrate my current ability and understanding of working with API requests and will continue to be updated in the future.
